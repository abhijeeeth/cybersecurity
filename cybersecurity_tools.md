# Common Cybersecurity Tools

Cybersecurity tools are essential for protecting computer systems and networks from threats. Here's an overview of some common tools used by security professionals.

## Network Scanning

*   **Nmap:** A network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a network. (See [Using Nmap](using_nmap.md))
*   **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic.

## Vulnerability Scanning

*   **Nessus:** A vulnerability scanner used to identify security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks.
*   **OpenVAS:** An open-source vulnerability scanner.

## Penetration Testing

*   **Metasploit:** A penetration testing framework used to develop and execute exploit code against target systems.
*   **Burp Suite:** A web application security testing tool used to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Intrusion Detection and Prevention

*   **Snort:** An open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS).
*   **Suricata:** Another open-source IDS/IPS engine.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

*   **Splunk:** A SIEM platform used to collect, analyze, and correlate security events from various sources.
*   **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** A popular open-source SIEM solution.

## Password Management

*   **Keepass:** A free open-source password manager.
*   **LastPass:** A commercial password manager.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

*   **CrowdStrike Falcon:** A cloud-based EDR platform.
*   **SentinelOne:** Another EDR solution.

This is not an exhaustive list, but it provides a starting point for exploring the world of cybersecurity tools. Each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best tool for a particular task will depend on the specific requirements.
