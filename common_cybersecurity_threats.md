# Common Cybersecurity Threats

Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and it's important to be aware of the most common types of attacks. Here are some of the prevalent threats:

## Malware

Malware is a broad term that includes various types of malicious software designed to harm computer systems.

*   **Viruses:** Self-replicating programs that spread by infecting files.
*   **Worms:** Self-replicating programs that spread across networks.
*   **Trojans:** Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software.
*   **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom for their decryption.
*   **Spyware:** Software that secretly monitors user activity and collects sensitive information.
*   **Adware:** Software that displays unwanted advertisements.

## Phishing

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that attempts to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Phishing attacks often involve deceptive emails, websites, or messages that appear to be legitimate.

## Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

A MitM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, allowing them to eavesdrop on or manipulate the data being transmitted.

## Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks

DoS and DDoS attacks flood a system or network with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks involve multiple compromised systems attacking a single target.

## SQL Injection

SQL injection is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in database applications, allowing attackers to execute malicious SQL code and gain unauthorized access to data.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into websites, which are then executed by unsuspecting users. This can allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface websites.

## Zero-Day Exploits

Zero-day exploits target vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor or public. These exploits are particularly dangerous because there are no patches or fixes available.

Understanding these common cybersecurity threats is crucial for implementing effective security measures and protecting against attacks.
